This file shows how Git marks merge conflicts (for reference only).
In a real conflict, Git inserts these markers into your file.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the version from the current branch (e.g. main).
Keep this if you want the main-branch change.
=======
This is the version from the branch being merged (e.g. feature/x).
Keep this if you want the feature-branch change.
>>>>>>> feature/x

To resolve: choose one version (or combine both), then delete the markers and the line you don't want. Save, then git add <file> and git commit.
